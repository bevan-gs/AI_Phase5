Energy Consumption Monitoring and Visualization

Overview
This project provides a Python-based automated system to measure energy consumption, analyze the data, and generate visualizations using the "AEP_hourly.csv" dataset. 
It's designed to help you gain insights into hourly energy consumption patterns and trends.

Contents
energy_consumption.py: The Python script that loads the dataset, performs data analysis, and generates data visualizations.
AEP_hourly.csv: The input dataset containing hourly energy consumption data.

Installation
1.Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/energy-consumption-analysis.git

2.Change to the project directory:
cd energy-consumption-analysis

3.Install the required libraries using pip:
pip install pandas matplotlib

Usage
1.Run the Python script to load the data, analyze it, and generate visualizations:
python energy_consumption.py

The script will display basic statistics of the dataset and a plot showing energy consumption over time.

2.Customize the code:

You can modify the code in energy_consumption.py to perform more advanced data analysis and create additional visualizations.
Ensure that the CSV file is correctly named and located in the same directory as the script. If not, modify the file path in the code.

About Dataset
The hourly power consumption data comes from PJM's website and are in megawatts (MW) for about 10 years.
The file is downloadable in zip form and extract it to get "AEP_hourly.csv"
